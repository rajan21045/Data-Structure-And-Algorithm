# Data-Structure-And-Algorithm

A personal learning repository for **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** in **C** — code implementations, problem solutions, class assignments, and resources.  
I'll post **what I learn by self-study** and **what our sir teaches in class**, all implemented in C, to track my progress and strengthen my problem-solving skills.

## 🆎 What is DSA?
- **Full form:** DSA stands for **"Data Structures and Algorithms"**.  
- **Definition:**  
  - **Data Structures** — ways of organizing and storing data for efficient access and modification (e.g., Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs).  
  - **Algorithms** — step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving problems efficiently.  
- **Why it’s important:** DSA is the backbone of efficient programming, essential for writing optimized code, and a key skill for technical interviews.

# 📌 What this repo is for
- Store **C code implementations** of data structures and algorithms.
- Save **classwork and assignments** given by sir.
- Keep **practice problems and challenges** solved by self-study.
- Maintain a **learning log** to track topics covered and progress.

# 🚀 Getting started
1. **Pick a programming language** — I am using **C** for all implementations.  
   (You can also use Java, C++, Python, etc., but this repo focuses on C.)
2. **Follow the learning flow**:
   - **Step 1:** Understand the concept (from sir’s lectures or self-study).
   - **Step 2:** Implement the code in C.
   - **Step 3:** Analyze time & space complexity.
   - **Step 4:** Practice problems based on the topic.
3. **Recommended platforms for practice**:
   - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com)
   - [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com)
   - [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com)
   - [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org)
